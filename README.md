Browsing the folders
====================
The folder structure is the following:

*    ``models``: The folder contains the neural network architectures.

*    ``configs``: The folder contains the yml files for the configuration, e.g., epochs to run, learning rate changes. Most of the options for hyper-parameters can be changed here and are propagated to the network. For instance, you can change the dataset from CIFAR10 to CIFAR100 by changing the respective name in yml.

*    ``utils``: Misc functions required for training.


Train the network
=================

To train the network, you can execute the following command::

   python train_main.py --config configs/resnet_default.yml --label any-name-you-want-as-label

If you want to call for CIFAR100, you can directly do that by using the ``resnet18_cifar100.yml`` yml file. 

**Changing the dataset:** You can change the dataset by changing the name of the ``dataset/db`` field (in the yml). The datasets that exist by default in PyTorch, e.g., CIFAR10/CIFAR100/MNIST, are automatically downloaded if they do not exist. They are exported in the path ``dataset/root`` (which is set to ``/tmp/``).

**Changing the resnet model:** You have two options: a) change the ``model/name`` (in the yml) to the resnet you want, e.g., ResNet34, b) change the ``model/name`` to ``ResNetnew`` and specify the number of of blocks with the argument ``num_blocks``.


The resnet model used in Î -nets paper is the one in ``configs/resnet_pi-net.yml``. 

Apart from PyTorch, the code depends on Pyaml [2]_.
